Extract folder from the tar.gz folder and copy it in
 your current working directory. 
From the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing 
this folder, say /home/USER/Desktop/Folder , by typing the 
following command ::
cd /home/USER/Desktop/Folder

Run the Makefile by typing the following command:
make -f Makefile

This step would compile the program.

This would result in creation of .class files in this folder.
If everything went well, there should not be any error messages.

If you are getting an error saying "PERMISSION DENIED", that means
you need to give privileges to your current working directory.
In order to do so, type the following command:
chmod -R 777 <absolutepathname>

where,
absolutepathname is the full pathname of the directory in which
you have copied the folder.

EXAMPLE:
chmod -R 777 /home/USER/Desktop/Folder


3. HOW TO EXECUTE : 
To run the Audio Matching program, execute a command of any of the 
following forms on CCIS Linux machine:

./dam -f <pathname> -f <pathname>
./dam -d <pathname> -d <pathname>
./dam -f <pathname> -d <pathname>
./dam -d <pathname> -f <pathname>

where <pathname> is a Linux path name. If <pathname> is preceded by -f, 
then the <pathname> should be of a file. If it is preceded by -d , 
it should be of a directory.

If the file is a wav file, file must be in little-endian (RIFF) WAVE
format with PCM encoding (AudioFormat 1), stereo or mono,
8- or 16-bit samples, with a sampling rate of 11.025, 22.05,
44.1, or 48 kHz. 

If the <pathname> ends in ".mp3", that file must be in the
MPEG-1 Audio Layer III format (MP3).

If the <pathname> ends in ".ogg", that file must be in a
format that version 1.4.0 of the oggdec program.

Acceptable file formats are .mp3,.wav and .ogg. Any other file given 
as input will result in an error with the following statement displayed 
on command line:
ERROR: Unsupported file format. 

If the program is stuck in an infinite loop,type CTRL + C to break 
out of it.

EXAMPLE(S): 

./dam -f ~/Desktop/A5/z01.wav -f ~/Desktop/A5/z02.wav
./dam -d ~/Desktop/Dir1 -d ~/Desktop/Dir2
./dam -f ~/Desktop/A5/z01.wav -d ~/Desktop/Dir1

4. CHECK EXIT STATUS: 
When the command line finishes execution, it returns an exit code. 
The exit code is not displayed on the screen by default. 
To examine the exit code, you need to write the following command :

echo $?

Exit status of :
0 denotes Success.
1 denotes Error. 

5. OUTPUT:
When two files match , following statement is shown on command line:
MATCH <fileName1> <fileName2> time1 time2

Where filename1 and filename2 are the names of the files that match,
time1 and time2 are respective offsets of file1 and file2 at which both
of them match.Nothing is printed in case of a mismatch. 
 
6. ERROR Handling:
Following checks are handled by the program and corresponding error 
messages are printed on command line. 
- ERROR: Not a directory -  If the given pathname does not exist and 
is not a directory.
- ERROR: Not a file -  If the given pathname is not a file (could
 be a directory) and the pathname is incorrect. 
- ERROR: unsupported file format - If the given file does not pass
 all matching criteria for a supported format/or is of a type 
unsupported by the program, this error will be printed on command line.

Following check is done on the arguments passed to command line 
through DAM:
-ERROR: incorrect command line - In the steps described under 
HOW TO EXECUTE, if any of the four arguments are skipped,
 dam script will throw this error.

EXAMPLE:
./dam -f -f /home/USER/Desktop/A5/z01.wav     
./dam /home/USER/Desktop/A5/z01.wav -f /home/USER/Desktop/A5/z02.wav

will result in ERROR: Incorrect Command Line.


7. EXECUTION TIME: 
To run two files, the program approximately takes 12-15 seconds to run.
To run two directories, the program will approximately 
take 27 seconds - 20 minutes.

8. REFERENCES: 
Third party software used is LAME and WAV executable
installed on CCIS linux machines under CS5500 folder to convert
incoming files to a standard canonical format.
